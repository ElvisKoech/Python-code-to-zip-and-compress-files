### Python-code-to-zip-and-compress-files

This Python code creates a zip file from multiple files using the `zipfile` module. It specifies the files to be included in the zip archive and the name of the output file. In the second part, the code opens the original zip file, reads its contents, and creates a new compressed zip file with the extracted data using the `ZIP_DEFLATED` compression method.
Finally, the original zip file is replaced with the new compressed zip file using the `os.replace()` function. Therefore, this code is useful when there is a need to create a zip file and compress it for efficient storage or transfer.
